Home DC

Home DC is my collection of resources for deploying my own datacenter.
Even though these resources are designed primarily for my own use, either personally or professionally, and to fit my own workflows, I am hoping they can be helpful to others as well.
Feel free to make any contributions!

This is also the main repository to hold content for the Home DC series in my [blog](http://igordc.com/2018/12/homedc-01-planning-my-first-personal-dev-cloud).
